					Welcome to Money Chart!!!
				</h2>
				<p>
					How many times did you look at your bills and was happy because you had money to pay them? Weird question am I right? Even when we pay our bills is hard to see something good from it.</p>
				<p>
					A lot of people around the world don't realize that having money is a good thing, even if it is to pay bills. That does not mean that we should go crazy and dive into a pile of credit card statements loans and etc, but what we definitely can do is learn how to deal with our money.</p>
				<p>
					Yeah! I said it, it's good to pay bills, that's is how things work, however not paying them can be very painful or even worst, like when you have money to pay your bills but you passed the due date :(. So with that thinking, I decided to build this website to help ALL!!! those people (me) pay their bills on time and visualize their expenses in order to plan new acquisitions.</p>
